# cookSip

A community-driven cooking app to save, share, and discover recipes.

This application was created to solve a personal problem. I love cooking, but sometimes I find myself lost, not knowing what to prepare.
That’s why I built this app: to keep track of recipes I already enjoy, easily reproduce them, and experiment without starting from scratch every time.

The best part is that it’s not just personal — users can share their recipes with others, and discover new ones in return.
It’s essentially a community-driven cooking app, where everyone can contribute, learn, and get inspired in the kitchen.
